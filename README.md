# 📊 Sales Analysis & Performance Dashboard (Excel)

This Excel dashboard helps managers track sales performance, compare targets vs achievements, and identify trends across regions and product categories. It replaces manual spreadsheet analysis with a clear, visual decision-making tool.

## Problem Statement

* **Data Size:** Monthly sales records with hundreds of rows
* **Key Fields:** Sales Amount, Units Sold, Sales Target, Product Category, Region, Month
